Impact of Push Notifications on Visual Attention

Smart working and industrial safety require constant monitoring of dashboards.
Push notifications may disrupt visual attention, leading to missed anomalies.
Understanding this impact is crucial for designing safer interfaces.


Research Question: How do push notifications affect visual attention and task performance?

Hypothesis 1: Notifications reduce anomaly detection accuracy.
Hypothesis 2: Notifications increase reaction time.
Hypothesis 3: Eye-tracking shows more gaze shifts and irrelevant fixations.
